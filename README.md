# Advent-of-Code-2018

This repo contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2018 https://adventofcode.com/.

These solutions all take an argument that is the file containing the input, or command line argument that are the single number input.

These solutions are not optomized for speed. My goal was for this to be a learning experience, and try my best to complete these challenges alone. After I solved the challenge I would look at others solutions to learn about more optimal ways to approach the problem and learn from that.
